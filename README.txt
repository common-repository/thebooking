== Description ==

**TheBooking** is a modern **booking plugin** to manage appointments and reservations, focused on usability and nice-looking user interface.

#### User friendly booking plugin

With its reactive calendar widget and a step-by-step reservation process, TheBooking allows customers to book your services in a snap!

#### Availability schedule

TheBooking implements an intuitive weekly planner to define availability hours, vacations and day offs.

* **Weekly working hours**: define the available time intervals for each day of the week.
* **Closing dates**: configure the day offs.
* **Booking time frame**: define (if needed) both reservation opening and closing time independently for any of your services

#### Reservation form

Define and customize a reservation form for each one of your services. TheBooking ships with a flexible **form builder**.

* **Custom fields**: add your desired fields in the reservation form to collect the data you need (even **files**!)
* **Conditional fields**: fields can be configured to show/hide or being required in consequence of values of other fields.
* **Validation**: apply the desired validation rule to any text field, if needed.

#### Zoom meetings and Google Meet

TheBooking integrates with Zoom and Google Meet to automate meetings creation and management for your services.

#### Google Calendar 2-ways and 3-ways integration

Connect your Google Calendar to see all your reservations there and to block available timeslots when busy. TheBooking is the **only** plugin that also allows you to **plan the availability directly through Google Calendar** (3-way) without the need to use the plugin backend to define time slots and opening hours.

#### Locations

Each service can have one or more locations that customer will be able to select during the booking process.

**Google Maps** is also supported.

#### Notification email messages

TheBooking is very powerful when it comes to build the perfect notification system for your booking system.

* **Complete stack** of notifications for any action: confirm, cancel, reschedule, approve, decline etc.
* **Differentiate by service**: any notification can be configured independently for each service
* **Dynamic content**: use placeholders to put dynamic data inside notification templates, such as service details, reservation details and customer's data
* **Advanced email content editor**: create amazing HTML email content thanks to the clarity and power of TinyMCE editor

#### Service restrictions

You can configure services to be booked by registered users only. Services can also be configured to require **approval** of the bookings.

#### Data export

Reservations and customers can be **conveniently exported** in *.CSV format.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes, 2-ways and 3-ways Google Calendar integrations are implemented. You can configure them as you please.

= Can I create virtual meetings? =

Yes, TheBooking integrates with Zoom. Just provide the API keys, and you will be able to offer virtual meetings to your customers to book. Meeting creation and management is automated.

= Can I change the customer or reschedule a reservation? =

Yes, any aspect of a reservation can be edited in the convenient backend dashboard. The plugin will take care of consistency across resources.

= Do all my services share the same availability schedule? =

Not necessarily. TheBooking is very flexible, so you can set a global availability schedule, or you can provide specific availabilities for some of your services.

= Do customers need to be registered in WordPress? =

This is configurable and up to you. The plugin can be configured in such a way that any new customer will be automatically linked to a new WordPress user or not. You can also restrict some of your services to be booked by registered users only.

= Can I suggest features and/or enhancements? =

Yes, please do so! You can do that via [GitHub](https://github.com/VonStroheim/thebooking "TheBooking repository")
